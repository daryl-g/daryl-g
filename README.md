<h1 align = "center">Hey, welcome to my GitHub profile! üëã</h1>

I am Daryl (Ich hei√üe Daryl), but I am also known as ƒêaÃÄo HoaÃÄng ThaÃÅi in my home country because it is my birth name! I am a Vietnamese-born (Saigonese, some might say), but I am currently based in Brisbane, Australia as I am pursuing a Computer & Data Science degree at the <a href = "https://www.qut.edu.au" target = "_blank">Queensland University of Technology</a>. My biggest interest at this point in time is sports analytics, especially using and applying data üî£ to football (soccer, for yall in the US of A; and sokkah for the Aussies). I also enjoy coding and developing websites and applications through various languages that I learned through my degree. For a coding nerd, I also have a soft spot for designing and game development, though I have never studied both of those fields. But I can design if needed and I have designed a few things in the past.

<h2 align = "left">üî≠ What have I done in the past?</h2>
<ul>

<li>Back in 2019 and early 2020, I used to be a writer for various football blogs like <a href = "https://totalfootballanalysis.com" target = "_blank">Total Football Analysis</a> and <a href = "https://betweentheposts.net" target = "_blank">Between The Posts</a>. I mainly analyse teams, players, and matches that I enjoyed watching, including teams in the English EFL Championship, Italian Serie A, France Ligue 1, Japan J1 League, Australia A-League Men, and various other leagues.

You can find all of my articles (not including the ones that are currently in my personal blog) here: [![Wakelet](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Wakelet-1DA1F2?style=for-the-badge&logo=wakelet)](https://wakelet.com/darylgouilard)</li>

<li>Starting from early 2020, I initially worked as a video analyst for a semi-professional football (soccer) team based in Brisbane, Australia named <a href = "https://olympicfc.net.au" target = "_blank">Brisbane Olympic</a> under the guidance of the amazing and highly-talented head coach <a href = "https://twitter.com/ben_cahn" target = "_blank">Ben Cahn</a>. My main tasks were to watch our opposition's matches and compile a report on their style of play at the start of the week.

By mid-2021 and throughout 2022, I was doing more coding and developing as part of my degree, and as a result of that, I took on the role of a data analyst at Olympic with the responsibility of providing pre-match and post-match visualisations which includes shot maps, passing networks, detailed passing and touch maps, etc. I have also created a data-driven dashboard using Python and Streamlit to allow the coaching staff and players to access the pre-match and post-match stats in their own time.</li>

</ul>

<h3 align = "left">üíª What projects have I worked on and contributed to?</h3>

Directly below this profile, I have pinned a few of the projects that I feel very proud about. Make sure you check it out! Besides from the projects below and in my Repositories tab, I have worked on and contributed to:

<ul>
<li>2023 <a href = "https://www.statsperform.com/resource/final-pro-track-presentations-confirmed-for-the-2023-opta-forum/" target = "_blank">Opta Forum</a> proposal: In early 2023, I had the privilege to work on a proposal about "Using Data to Evaluate the Efficiency of Channel Attacks and Defence" to present as a poster at the 2023 Opta Forum. Despite the limitations and obstacles that I faced along the way, I felt very proud to contribute one of my "crazy" ideas to such an important event in the football (soccer) analytics calendar.</li>

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<h3 align = "left">üé® Which projects have I worked on that involves designing?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href = "https://photos.app.goo.gl/gcPqGR54vziArLgUA" target = "_blank">Scouting Handbook 2.0</a>: In 2019, I was inspired by the work of <a href = "https://www.scoutedftbl.com" target = "_blank">ScoutedFtbl</a> to create my own version of the Scouting Handbook for the Vietnamese audience. After the <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xn1qP-4kgZj5XqxaKtW0FW7Ym-QDGdIi/view?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">first version</a>, I wanted to create a second edition of the handbook. However, due to time limitation, I can only finish the design for the pages in the handbook without ever write any scout reports. These designs are also inspired by the card designs of Topps Kick, which is a digital football/soccer card collecting game.</li>
  
  <li>2022/23 Graphics for <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/SaintsVN" target = "_blank">Southampton FC Vietnam</a>: Currently, I am running a Facebook page that acts as a fanpage for the football/soccer club Southampton FC that targets the Vietnamese audience. As part of our rebranding for the 2022/23 season, I was inspired by the designs of the official Southampton FC social media pages while also adding my own touches and repurposing the designs for its respective purposes. I have not arranged all of my designs into a Behance (or something equivalent) yet, but I will probably do this at the end of the 22/23 season.

</ul>

<h2 align = "left">üí¨ Which languages can I speak?</h2>

Slightly different to the languages above, here are the languages that I can speak!

<ul>
<li>Vietnamese, because of course, if I cannot speak Vietnamese after being born and lived there for almost 18 years, what have I done with my life?</li>
<li>English. Not proficient, but I consider my English to be good. At least that's what my IELTS score (6.0) told me.</li>
<li>German. Yeah I teased a little bit of my German at the start, but I can speak a little bit of German (ich spreche ein bisschen Deutsch) as I am self-learning the language.</li>

</ul>
